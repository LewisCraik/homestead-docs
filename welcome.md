# Laravel Homestead

Laravel strives to make the entire PHP development experience delightful, including your local development environment. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) provides a simple, elegant way to manage and provision Virtual Machines.

Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. No more worrying about messing up your operating system! Vagrant boxes are completely disposable. If something goes wrong, you can destroy and re-create the box in minutes!

Homestead runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux system, and includes Nginx, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, Node, and all of the other goodies you need to develop amazing Laravel applications.

Homestead works on the current Ubuntu LTS 20.04 and the previous Ubuntu LTS 18.04.
